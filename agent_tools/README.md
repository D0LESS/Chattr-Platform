## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

- **All destructive, sensitive, or potentially unsafe actions** (edit, install, run, call, restore) require explicit conversational approval.
- **All events, edits, errors, API calls, and executions** are centrally, securely logged via `RagisLogger` (timestamp, file/target, action, summary, with PII masking as configured).
- **No secrets, keys, tokens, or credentials** are written to log or file‚Äîuse the `secure_vault.py` module (outside this folder) for secure PIN-locked storage and retrieval.
- **All tools are modular, auditable, and designed for continuous improvement and easy extension.**
